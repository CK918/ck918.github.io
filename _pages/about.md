Hello! I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. student at National Taiwan University, where I focus on trustworthy machine learning, learning theory, and financial applications. My research aims to develop robust algorithms that ensure security and privacy.

During my Ph.D., I have delved deeply into learning theory, exploring how theoretical models can be applied to ensure the reliability and efficiency of machine learning algorithms under various constraints. This exploration includes addressing issues related to data security and privacy to create equitable and ethical AI systems.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I completed a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. This foundation has equipped me with a strong grasp of statistical modeling and computational methods, crucial for my current research focus.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I regularly work out at the gym. Engaging in this disciplined physical activity not only keeps me fit but also sharpens my focus and resilience, which in turn enhances my capacity for innovative thinking and problem-solving in my research.

If you are interested in collaboration or wish to discuss research opportunities, please feel free to connect with me.
